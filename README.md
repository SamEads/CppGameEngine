# (Currently Unnamed) C++ Game Engine

A lightweight, cross-platform C++ game engine focused on 2D and 3D game development. This engine is built with performance and flexibility in mind, and is continuously evolving as I work on personal projects.

## Features

### Core Systems
- Cross-platform filesystem
- State/scene management system for game states and levels
- High-resolution timer for precise timing operations
- Familiar Java-style Random implementation

### Graphics
- 2D/3D rendering powered by raylib
- Dynamic texture atlas system with 2D bin packing

### Audio
- 2D/3D OGG audio support via OpenAL Soft
- Positional audio
- Sound effect and music management

### Utilities
- String manipulation tools
- Interpolation utilities
- Math helper functions

### Upcoming Features
- Networking support using enet
- Lua scripting integration with sol2
- Physics system expansion
- AABB collision detection for both 2D and 3D

## Dependencies
- [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) - Graphics and input
- [OpenAL Soft](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft) - Audio system
